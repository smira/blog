Today I've released `aptly <http://www.aptly.info/>`_ version 0.3. It's the first version I would recommend for production usage.
Please `download it <http://www.aptly.info/#download>`_ or install from `source <https://github.com/smira/aptly>`_,
`raise issues <https://github.com/smira/aplty/issues>`_, disscuss in
`aptly-discuss group <https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/aptly-discuss>`_, follow `me (@smira) <https://twitter.com/smira/>`_
to get information about updates.

New features:

* using `aptly serve <http://www.aptly.info/#aptly-serve>`_ command you can quickly serve your published repositories over HTTP,
  aptly would even advise right settings for apt sources;
* aptly checks signatures and verifies checksums for downloaded files while mirroring remote repositories, if you don't have
  key that was used to sign the mirror in your trusted GnuPG keychain, aptly would give some hints,
  `some hints <http://www.aptly.info/#aptly-mirror-create>`_;
* flat format of Debian repositories is now supported (e.g. `OBS <https://build.opensuse.org>`_ creates repositories in such format);
* now you can drop `mirrors <http://www.aptly.info/#aptly-mirror-drop>`_ and
  `snapshots <http://www.aptly.info/#aptly-snapshot-drop>`_;
* aptly can `draw graph of relationships <http://www.aptly.info/#aptly-graph>`_ between your mirros, snapshots and published
  repositories;
* `bash completion <https://github.com/aptly-dev/aptly-bash-completion>`_ is available for aptly, try it out, it's amazing!
* aptly gained ability to `create empty snapshot <http://www.aptly.info/#aptly-snapshot-create>`_, it could be useful if you'd
  like to extract part of repository by `pulling <http://www.aptly.info/#aptly-snapshot-pull>`_ packages;
* custom config location could be given with flag ``-config``.

Nice picture (actually it's output of `aptly graph <http://www.aptly.info/#aptly-graph>`_ command):
