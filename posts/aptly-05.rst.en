`aptly <http://www.aptly.info>`_ 0.5 has been released today. It is available for download as
`binary executables <http://www.aptly.info#download>`_ or from Debian repository::

    deb http://repo.aptly.info/ squeeze main

When installing from repository, don't forget to import key used to sign the release::

    $ gpg --keyserver keys.gnupg.net --recv-keys 2A194991
    $ gpg -a --export 2A194991 | sudo apt-key add -

Most important new features are:

Local Repository Publishing
---------------------------

Local repositories could be used in two ways:

* test new versions of software
* provide stable distribution of new versions

For the second case, it is best to create snapshots of local repositories and publish them.
However, when testing out new versions, there isn't much sense in creating snapshot each time
repository is updated. So aptly since version 0.5 supports
`direct publishing of repositories <http://www.aptly.info/#aptly-publish-repo>`_.
Moreover, when local repository is updated, published repository could be updated
as well in `one step <http://www.aptly.info/#aptly-publish-update>`_.

When local repository is created, default publishing options (distribution and component)
could be specified, so that these options don't need to be specified when publishing::

    aptly repo create -distribution=wheezy testing-wheezy
    aptly repo add -remove-files testing-wheezy incoming/*.deb
    aptly publish repo testing-wheezy
    ...
    aptly repo add -remove-files testing-wheezy incoming/*.deb
    aptly publish update wheezy

.. TEASER_END

Published Snapshot Switching
----------------------------

Snapshot is a way to make package environment stable and repeatable, but from time to time
new snapshots are created that contain new versions of software. To publish new version
of snapshot, aptly before 0.5 required old snapshot to be unpublished and new snapshot to
be published again. During this process, repository would be unusable.

New feature allows to
`"switch" snapshots in published repository <http://www.aptly.info/#aptly-publish-switch>`_.
aptly would do its best to minimize repository downtime:

* first, new packages files are linked to published root
* new metadata files (``Packages``, ``Release``, ...) are created in temporary locations
* new versions of metadata files are moved to final locations
* old package files are cleaned up from the pool (if required).

For example::

    aptly snapshot create wheezy-7.3 from mirror wheezy-main
    aptly publish snapshot wheezy-7.3
    ....
    aptly mirror update wheezy-main
    aptly snapshot create wheezy-7.4 from mirror wheezy-main
    aptly publish switch wheezy wheezy-7.4

Merge Strategy
--------------

When `merging snapshots <http://www.aptly.info/#aptly-snapshot-merge>`_ aptly would override
packages with the version from the latest argument on the command line. This works ok
if you merge, for example regular repository and backports. But sometimes this is not enough,
e.g. when merging regular repository, updates and security repository. aptly now supports
flag ``-latest`` to change merge strategy to "latest version wins"::

    aptly snapshot merge -latest wheezy-latest wheezy-backports wheezy-main wheezy-security

Thanks to `Ryan Uber <https://github.com/ryanuber>`_ and `Keith Chambers <https://github.com/keithchambers>`_ for the
idea and pull request.

Scripting
---------

Sometimes you need to perform bunch of actions with mirrors, snapshots or repositories. aptly 0.5 supports
special "raw" listing which is easily parseable. E.g. update all Debian mirrors::

    aptly mirror list -raw | grep -E '^debian-.*' | xargs -n 1 aptly mirror update

Thanks to `Eric Keller <https://github.com/erickeller>`_ for the idea.
